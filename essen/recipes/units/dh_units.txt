# Syntax
# ======
# Units
# -----
# <canonical name> = <relation to another unit or dimension> [= <symbol>] [= <alias>] [ = <alias> ] [...]
#
# The canonical name and aliases should be expressed in singular form.
# Pint automatically deals with plurals built by adding 's' to the singular form; plural
# forms that don't follow this rule should be instead explicitly listed as aliases.
#
# If a unit has no symbol and one wants to define aliases, then the symbol should be
# conventionally set to _.
#
# Example:
#     millennium = 1e3 * year = _ = millennia
#
#
# Prefixes
# --------
# <prefix>- = <amount> [= <symbol>] [= <alias>] [ = <alias> ] [...]
#
# Example:
#     deca- =  1e+1  = da- = deka-
#
#
# Derived dimensions
# ------------------
# [dimension name] = <relation to other dimensions>
#
# Example:
#     [density] = [mass] / [volume]
#
# Note that primary dimensions don't need to be declared; they can be
# defined for the first time in a unit definition.
# E.g. see below `meter = [length]`
#
#
# Additional aliases
# ------------------
# @alias <canonical name or previous alias> = <alias> [ = <alias> ] [...]
#
# Used to add aliases to already existing unit definitions.
# Particularly useful when one wants to enrich definitions
# from defaults_en.txt with custom aliases.
#
# Example:
#     @alias meter = my_meter
