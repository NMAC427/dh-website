# German House Website

[German House](http://dh.mit.edu/) is a residence hall that prides itself in (among other things) its independence from dining halls! We have a highly coordinated system of shoppers, meal stewards, and rotating cookcrews that work together to feed our community of 30 people, using the recipes and menus hosted on our own website!

## Setup

To set up a local development environment, run the `setup_local_dev` command.
This should automatically set up and install everything.
You can then start the server by running the `runserver` script.

## Documentation
