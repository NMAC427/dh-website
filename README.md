I spent my time at [German House](http://dh.scripts.mit.edu/) which is a residence hall that prides itself in independence from dining halls! We have a highly coordinated system of shoppers, meal stewards, and rotating cookcrews that work together to feed our community of 30 people, using the recipes and menus (here is an [example](http://dh.scripts.mit.edu/essen/03/01/2020/) hosted on our own website!
