# German House Website

[German House](http://dh.mit.edu/) is a residence hall that prides itself in (among other things) its independence from dining halls! We have a highly coordinated system of shoppers, meal stewards, and rotating cookcrews that work together to feed our community of 30 people, using the recipes and menus hosted on our own website!

Take a gander!
